# Sub-Agents

Sub-agents are persistent background instances of the agent loop. The parent
opens one with a focused task, gets back an `agent_id` and session name
immediately, and continues working while the sub-agent runs to completion.
Sub-agents inherit the parent's tool registry by default and run with
`CancellationToken::child_token()`, so cancelling the parent cancels every
descendant.

This doc covers the role taxonomy. The active orchestration surface is
`agent_open`, `agent_eval`, and `agent_close`; see `prompts/base.md`
"Sub-Agent Strategy" and the in-line tool descriptions.

## Role taxonomy

The `type` field on `agent_open` selects a system-prompt posture for the child
(`agent_type` is accepted as a compatibility alias). Each role is a distinct
stance toward the work — not just a different label.

| Role          | Stance                                      | Writes? | Runs shell? | Typical use                                      |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|---------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `general`     | flexible; do whatever the parent says       | yes     | yes         | the default; multi-step book tasks              |
| `explore`     | read-only; map relevant book assets fast    | no      | yes (read)  | "map 林墨's appearances and open promises"       |
| `plan`        | analyze and produce a story strategy        | minimal | minimal     | "design the next volume arc; don't execute"     |
| `review`      | continuity and memory diagnosis             | no      | no          | "audit chapter 12 for knowledge leaks"          |
| `implementer` | land a specific book artifact               | yes     | yes         | "revise chapters/012/final.md from the audit"   |
| `verifier`    | validate book gates and report outcome      | no      | yes (test)  | "verify memory candidates and export readiness" |
| `custom`      | explicit narrow tool allowlist              | depends | depends     | locked-down dispatch with hand-picked tools     |

Each role's full system prompt lives in
`crates/tui/src/tools/subagent/mod.rs` (search for
`*_AGENT_PROMPT`). The prompt prefix loads automatically when the
child agent boots; the parent's assignment prompt becomes the first
turn's user message.

## Context forking

`agent_open` starts fresh by default: the child gets its role prompt plus the
task you pass. Use `fork_context: true` when the child should continue from
the parent's current request prefix instead. In fork mode the runtime keeps the
parent prefill/prompt prefix byte-identical where available, appends a
structured state snapshot, then adds the sub-agent role instructions and task
at the tail. That preserves DeepSeek prefix-cache reuse while giving the child
the context needed for continuation, review, summarization, or compaction work.

Use fresh sessions for independent exploration. Use forked sessions when the
task depends on decisions, files, todos, or plan state already in the parent
transcript.

### When to pick which role

- **`general`** — when the task is "do this whole thing", not "go
  look", "design", or "verify". This is the right default; reach for
  a more specific role only when the posture matters.
- **`explore`** — when the parent needs evidence before deciding what
  to do next. Explorers are cheap and fast; open 2–3 in parallel
  for independent regions of the book.
  They should orient first: confirm the book root (`book.toml`), read relevant
  bible/cards/outline/chapter/memory assets, search only the likely scope, and
  return `path:line-range` evidence instead of a narrative tour. The role name
  to use is `explore` or `explorer`.
- **`plan`** — when the parent has an objective but no executable
  decomposition. Planners write artifacts (`update_plan` rows,
  `checklist_write` entries) but don't carry them out.
- **`review`** — when a chapter, outline, card, or memory update needs
  continuity diagnosis. Reviewers don't rewrite prose — they describe the
  compatible fix, affected story nodes, and candidate memory updates so the
  parent can dispatch an Implementer if a revision is needed.
- **`implementer`** — when the requested book artifact is already specified
  and just needs to land. Implementers stay tightly scoped: preserve user
  prose unless replacement is explicit, edit only the assigned assets, and run
  a quick verification before handing back.
- **`verifier`** — when the parent needs an authoritative pass/fail on a book
  gate: chapter file exists, export is complete, memory candidates were
  applied, no obvious continuity conflict remains. Verifiers don't fix
  failures; they capture evidence and put fix candidates under RISKS.
- **`custom`** — only when the parent needs to constrain the tool
  set explicitly. Pass the allowlist via the `allowed_tools` field
  on `agent_open`.

### Aliases

The model can spell each role multiple ways:

| Canonical     | Aliases                                                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `general`     | `worker`, `default`, `general-purpose`                           |
| `explore`     | `explorer`, `exploration`                                        |
| `plan`        | `planning`, `awaiter`                                            |
| `review`      | `reviewer`, `continuity`, `memory-review`                        |
| `implementer` | `implement`, `implementation`, `builder`                         |
| `verifier`    | `verify`, `verification`, `validator`, `tester`                  |
| `custom`      | (none; explicit `allowed_tools` array required)                  |

All matching is case-insensitive. Unknown values produce a typed
error listing the accepted set, so the model can self-correct on
the next turn.

## Concurrency cap

The dispatcher caps concurrent sub-agents at 10 by default
(configurable via `[subagents].max_concurrent` in `~/.deepseek/config.toml`,
hard ceiling 20). When the parent hits the cap, `agent_open` returns
an error with the cap value; the parent should use `agent_eval` to wait for
completion or `agent_close` to free a slot before retrying.

The cap counts only **running** agents — completed / failed /
cancelled records persist for inspection but don't occupy a slot.
Agents that lost their `task_handle` (e.g. across a process
restart) also don't count against the cap.

## Lifecycle

Each opened session produces a record that progresses through:

```
Pending → Running → (Completed | Failed(reason) | Cancelled | Interrupted(reason))
```

`Interrupted` fires when the manager detects a `Running` agent
whose task handle is gone — typically after a process restart that
loaded the agent from `~/.deepseek/subagents.v1.json`. The parent
can open a replacement session with the same assignment or treat it as a
terminal state.

### Session boundaries (#405)

Each `SubAgentManager` instance assigns itself a fresh
`session_boot_id` on construction. Every new session stamps the agent
with that id; the persisted state file carries it across restarts.

`agent_eval` and the sidebar/status projections focus on current-session
agents by default. Prior-session agents that are not still running are treated
as archived records so the model does not mistake stale work for live work.

Records that loaded from a pre-#405 persisted state file (no
`session_boot_id` field) classify as prior-session because the
manager can't match them to the current boot.

## Output contract

Every sub-agent produces a final result string with five sections,
in order:

```
SUMMARY:    one paragraph; what you did and what happened
CHANGES:    files modified, with one-line descriptions; "None." if read-only
EVIDENCE:   path:line-range citations and key findings; one bullet each
RISKS:      what could go wrong / what the parent should double-check
BLOCKERS:   what stopped you; "None." if you finished cleanly
```

The exact format lives in `crates/tui/src/prompts/subagent_output_format.md`.
The parent reads `EVIDENCE` as a working set for the next turn, so
explorers and reviewers should be precise here.

## Memory and the `remember` tool (#489)

Sub-agents inherit the parent's optional personal memory file when memory is
enabled (`[memory] enabled = true` or `DEEPSEEK_MEMORY=on`). They can append
durable operator notes via the `remember` tool, but book canon belongs in the
Novel Studio assets: `bible/`, `cards/`, `chapters/`, `memory/summaries/`, and
the memory ledgers under `memory/*.jsonl`.

Personal memory writes are scoped to the user's own `memory.md` file; they do
not update the book memory graph. For durable story facts, write or request
candidate memory updates through the book workflow.

## Implementation notes

- Source: `crates/tui/src/tools/subagent/mod.rs` (about 3500 LOC).
- Persisted state: `~/.deepseek/subagents.v1.json`. Schema version
  `1` (forward-compatible — new optional fields use
  `#[serde(default)]`).
- The `is_running` check ignores agents whose `task_handle` is
  `None`; this avoids counting persisted-but-detached records
  toward the concurrency cap (#509).
- `SharedSubAgentManager` is `Arc<RwLock<...>>` — read paths use
  read locks so `/agents` and the sidebar projection don't block
  the main loop during multi-agent fan-out (#510).
